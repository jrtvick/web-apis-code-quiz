# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

## Description

I set out to create a javascript file that would lead the user through. I built this project to test my knowledge of JavaScript web APIs and expand on what I had learned in class through outside research. This entire experience was a learning experience as JavaScript and web APIs are brand new to me and still overwhelming, but specifically I learned about using timers, event listeners, arrays,  and query selectors.
